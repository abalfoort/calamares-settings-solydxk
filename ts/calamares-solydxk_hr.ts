        <source>&lt;h3&gt;Safe updates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some operating systems make updating your system harder than it really needs to be. SolydXK thinks upgrades should be quick and easy, and then get out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Update Manager sits discreetly in your system tray and lets you know when updates are available. You don&apos;t have to apply updates when you don&apos;t want to. The Update Manager won&apos;t pop up or annoy you in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All updated files are maintained and closely checked by trusted developers and maintainers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All files are stored in special secure repositories for your use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The security repository is synchronized daily.</source>
